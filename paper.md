The *lpjmlkit* R package [@lpjmlkit_manual] is an open source software for
handling the open source Dynamic Global Vegetation model (DGVM)
[LPJmL](https://github.com/PIK-LPJmL/LPJmL) mainly developed and maintained
by the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research (PIK).
It contains two main modules. One, called *LPJmL Runner*, provides the
functionality to create model configurations for
multiple simulations at once and run them either on a configured local machine
or on an HPC cluster with SLURM support.\
The other, called *LPJmL Data* offers a generic read function that supports both
simulation output and model input data for multiple file format types. The associated data
class *LPJmLData* contains both the data and the corresponding metadata to ensure
the integrity of both within an instantiated object. LPJmLData objects can be
modified to a limited extent **[maybe say something on why only to limited extent and what that limit is for?]** 
and exported to other common R data formats.
In addition to these modules, further functions that facilitate 
common use cases of LPJmL are included. This article introduces *lpjmlkit*,
an R package that serves as an interface to LPJmL and thus both simplifies
direct work with the model and enables new software developments **[enables new software development -- unclear what that means?]**.


# Statement of need

A simple interface makes software easier to use and improves accessibility,
user experience, and overall adoption. Especially in science, where it is rather
the exception for someone to have substantial training in both computer science and the
natural-sciences needed to meaningfully design and interpret simulation experiments. 
Often, the progressive development of complex process-based
numerical models in low-level languages like C comes at the expense of
usability, making them accessible only to experienced users.
*lpjmlkit* has come to break with this trend and serve as an API for the  
model called LPJmL, a well-established and widely-used dynamic global vegetation, hydrology and crop model, 
widely used in the scientific community.\
LPJmL has been in use for more than a decade and was employed by researchers
to conduct numerous studies in various research areas around the
terrestrial biosphere. To this end, the dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) LPJ was extended by
scientists at PIK by adding the hydroligcal cycle [@gerten_terrestrial_2004],
by implementing managed land components, forming "LPJmL" (LPJ with *m*anaged *L*and))
[@bondeau_modelling_2007; @rolinski_modeling_2018; @lutz2019simulating; @Porwollik2022cover],
and by including the nitrogen cycle [@von_bloh_implementing_2018].\
This allowed for broader, interdisciplinary studies such as the work of
@gerten_feeding_2020, which answered the question of whether it is possible to
feed ten billion people within four planetary boundaries, or studies that
implemented features of sustainable agriculture in LPJmL [@Porwollik2022cover; @Herzfeld2021soc] 
that had not been simulated before within a DGVM. LPJmL is also used extensively in the context of
simulating natural vegetation dynamics with disturbances such as fire. ...
**TODO** ...\
However, unlike its sister model LPJ-GUESS [@bagnara_r_2019] or other
models at PIK [@dietrich_magpie_2019] LPJmL was never equipped with standardised
interfaces for higher level programming languages to either run simulations or
read and process input or output data.\
This makes it difficult for beginners to work with LPJmL, but even scientists
who have been using LPJmL for a while had to develop their own scripts and tools
for routine data processing instead of using a generic, standardized interface.
Numerous scripts have been shared, adapted
and reapplied among scientists. Naturally, bugs were introduced and a lot of time was spent
debugging, updating or adapting them to new model developments. **[I'm not sure on this one, lpjmlkit does not solve the problem of introducinb bugs to the LPJmL code and the need fore debugging... I'd leave that out and say something on wasting resources by re-creating standard processing routines]**\
`lpjmlkit` was developed to eliminate these problems and at the same time create
a standard in the handling of LPJmL to improve the design of simulation experiments
and the transparency of studies with LPJmL **[Not sure how that increases transparency of studies, maybe elaborate on that a bit more]**.\
This way `lpjmlkit` serves as an application programming interface (API) to 
LPJmL and provides an easy-to-use basis for interaction with LPJmL in a simple
R script as well as for further software development based on LPJmL **[future software development component not entirely clear, elaborate]**.
