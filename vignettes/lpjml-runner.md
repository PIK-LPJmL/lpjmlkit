**LPJmL Runner** is the collective term for a set of functions within
**`lpjmlKit`** that have the goal to simplify the execution of
simulations with LPJmL and furthermore to execute complex, nested and
multiple simulation sequences fast and error free without having a big
(bash) script overhead.

Setup
-----

Please make sure to have set the [working environment for
LPJmL](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/lpjml/LPJmL_internal/-/blob/master/INSTALL)
correctly if you are not working on the PIK cluster (with [Slurm
Workload
Manager](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/about/it-services/hpc/user-guides/slurm)).
Else it is recommended to add something like this to the working
environment or your `".profile"`.

    export LPJROOT=<PATH_TO_LPJML_REPOSITORY>

    module load lpjml

Overview
--------

1.  First of all you have to think about what LPJmL parameters/settings
    (here all referred to as parameters) you want to change. You are
    free to change them directly in the corresponding `"js"` file or in
    the `tibble` (see example). For a single simulation this is a matter
    of personal routine, but when it comes to multiple runs where these
    parameters differ from each other, you have to specify them in a
    `tibble`.  
    `?write_config` *for more information.*

        my_params <- tibble(
          sim_name = c("scenario1", "scenario2"),
          random_seed = c(42, 404),
          param.k_temp = c(NA, 0.03),
          new_phenology = c(TRUE, FALSE)
        )

2.  Now the central function here is `write_config`, it creates and
    writes the LPJmL Configuration (Config) file(s) `"config_*.json"`
    from a table (`tibble`) with the parameters of a base `"lpjml.js"`
    file to be changed.  
    `?write_config` *for more information.*

        config_details <- write_config(my_params, model_path, output_path)

3.  To check whether your Config(s) are valid for LPJmL you can pass the
    the returned `tibble` to `check_lpjml`. It wonâ€™t raise an error
    (dependencies might not be satisfied yet) but will print/return the
    information of `lpjcheck`.

        lpjml_check(config_details, model_path, output_path)

4.  Based on `write_config` you are now able to either execute the LPJmL
    simulation(s) for the Config file(s) via `submit_lpjml` or run it
    (interactively) locally via `run_lpjml`. `run_lpjml` can also be
    utilized within slurm jobs to execute multiple single cell runs.  
    `?submit_lpjml` *or* `?run_lpjml` *for more information.*

        # submit to Slurm
        run_details <- submit_lpjml(config_details, model_path, output_path)

        # OR (interactively) locally
        run_details <- run_lpjml(config_details, model_path, output_path)

5.  Around the Config file there are two helpful utility functions:

    1.  `read_config` to read a `"config_*.json"` file as a nested R
        list object
    2.  `view_config` to use the `View` function for a tree
        visualization of a `"config_*.json"` file

6.  Besides `check_lpjml` there is also a `make_lpjml` function for
    compiling LPJmL.

Usage
-----

    library(lpjmlKit)
    library(tibble)

    model_path <- "./LPJmL_internal"
    output_path <-"./my_runs"

#### Interactive single cell runs

compare old and new phenology


    my_params <- tibble(
      sim_name = c("spinup_oldphen",
                   "spinup_newphen",
                   "transient_oldphen",
                   "transient_newphen"),
      new_phenology = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
      startgrid = c(27410, 27410, 27410, 27410),
      river_routing = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),
      order = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
      dependency = c(NA, NA, "spinup_oldphen", "spinup_newphen")
    )

    # write config files
    config_details <- write_config(params = my_params,
                                   model_path = model_path,
                                   output_path = output_path)

    # check config & LPjMl
    check_config(config_details, model_path, output_path)

    # execute runs sequently
    run_details <- run_lpjml(config_details, model_path, output_path)

#### Nested simulation sequences on the PIK cluster
